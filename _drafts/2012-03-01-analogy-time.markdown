There’s nothing better than a good analogy to help us visualize something. I’ve been thinking about building software as it relates to consuming food this morning. I started off with just grocery shopping, but missed the obvious buy vs build correlation.

That’s a simple one to grasp. You either build (make your food at home) or buy (eat out). The more you spend is usually a good indication of the quality of product you get back. There are times when you don’t get what you pay for: the project is late or lacking features or has a bunch of bugs just like the prepared food you buy may make you sick or taste like crap or isn’t enough to fill you up.

Our household tends to build when it comes to eating. Not because of NIH syndrome, but because it tends to be cheaper. That requires another step in the process which is getting the materials to build…inventory. Not inventory of finished goods (that’s another problem, but generally limited to how many leftovers you can cram into your fridge), but inventory of raw materials.

That’s where my wife and I differ on our philosophies. I tend to buy just in time, she tries to think of everything we might ever need in the next 2 weeks. She has a giant requirements document in her head, I have a 3 x 5 notecard with just enough to get the task at hand done.

Like software, requirements in eating change…turns out we don’t really need 7 cans of mushrooms this week. This kind of buying wreaks havoc on my other love, budgeting. It’s not like we’ll never use the 18 cans of green beans, it’s just that we don’t need them all at once.

So there’s sometimes some tension at the end of a budgeting period or sprint when there’s no more money left for groceries or there’s no more time left to build these features we said we were going to do. The cost of groceries is definitely going up just like the cost of delivering software is going up, but it’s not going up at the extreme it seems to when we have batch sizes that are too big (and anything over a batch size of 1 is too big).

Keep a list of meals you can cook and like, pick one you’re going to eat, go to the grocery store and get the stuff you need to complete it, make it, eat it.

Keep a backlog of features that are wanted and bugs that need to be fixed, pick one, do it, ship it.
