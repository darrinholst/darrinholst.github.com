On one of the [Back to Work](http://5by5.tv/b2w) episodes Merlin talks about the life triangle. I'm not sure he calls it exactly that, but the gist is that you have three corners of you life:

  * Work
  * Sleep
  * Everything Else

Work and sleep are pretty obvious, but everything else is kind of ambiguous. To me everything else is literally _everything else_. Cooking supper, helping your kids with their homework, watching a movie, getting sick, taking the garbage out, etc.

The point of the triangle is that the sum of those angles is always going to be 180 (24 hours in our day in the life example). You get to choose the ratio, but you never get more than 24 hours.

##Sleep
For me sleep is non-negotiable, at least over the long term. I know how much sleep I need in order to keep doing the stuff I do every day. Sure, you could binge for a day or two, but that's not sustainable. 7 - 8 hours a day is what I usually need.

##Work
That leaves you with two more buckets to fill. Work, to me, means everything that you do that you directly get paid for _and_ everything that you do that may help you get paid at a later date. This includes attending user group meetings, contributing to open source projects, reading books or blogs. Stuff that you don't get paid for, but contibutes in any amout to your career. (If you do get paid for this stuff please contact me) 

##Everything Else
So now that you have sleep and work all figured out the rest is easy. You just take `24 -  hours_of_sleep - hours_of_work` to get what you have left for everything else. The question is __Are you ok with that answer?__. If you're a bachelor are you cool with less hours invested in a social life for more hours invested in a sweet jQuery plugin? If you have kids are you cool with not playing Mickey Mouse with your 3 year old so you can read one more blog post?

##Thoughts from Mr Obvious
My point is not to judge, but to point out that it's a giant balancing act and your triangle can and will change all the time. The smart kids are the ones that figure out that it's a long game and are cognizant of their ratios.
