If youâ€™ve built ruby yourself and stuck it in /usr/local/bin you may run into a problem where textmate is using the pre-installed version of ruby. That will result in searching for gems in the pre-installed location (wherever that is)

To fix this add a shell variable called TM_RUBY in the advanced preferences of TM pointing to /usr/local/bin/ruby
