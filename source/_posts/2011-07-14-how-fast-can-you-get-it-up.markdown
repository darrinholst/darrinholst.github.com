So with OS X Lion just around the corner I’ve been thinking about the steps to get my computer up and running from a fresh install. You do do a fresh install, right? I’ll be testing these steps out in the next couple of weeks, but here’s what I have in my head…

* install OS X development tools (do I have to buy this now from the App Store?)
* install [iTerm](http://www.iterm2.com/) (because Terminal.app is a little long in the tooth)
* install [Homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew)
* brew install ack git tig wget
* install [rvm](https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/)
* rvm install 1.9.2
* rvm —default use 1.9.2
* gem install rake (might be installed by default)
* git clone https://github.com/darrinholst/dotfiles .dotfiles (you should save your config files somewhere)
* cd .dotfiles
* rake link (symlinks everything into my home directory)
* install [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) (because who uses bash anymore?)
* install [janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus) (I’m a vim guy)
* install [MacVim](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/)
* install my [favorite font of the week](https://github.com/andreberg/Meslo-Font)

At this point I could start to get some work done…but what fun is that? These are the apps that I’ll need right away

* [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome)
* [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)
* [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) (app launcher)
* [SizeUp](http://irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/) (window sizer)

and these are the apps that I’ll install as I need them

* [Adium](http://adium.im/) (chat)
* [Caffeine](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/) (keeps my computer awake when I want it to)
* [Charles](http://www.charlesproxy.com/) (http proxy for debugging)
* [DrawIt](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/drawit) (vector image editor)
* [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/new/)
* [IntelliJ](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
* [Notational Velocity](http://notational.net/) (plain text file organizer)
* [Pixelmator](http://www.pixelmator.com/) (image editor)
* [Propane](http://propaneapp.com/) (Campfire wrapper)
* [Rulers](http://itunes.apple.com/app/rulers/id415310758?mt=12) (measures stuff)
* [Skitch](http://skitch.com/) (screen shots)
* [Twitter](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id409789998?mt=12)
* [VMWare Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/overview.html)

That’s at least a good 3 days of standup updates, I’ll update with anything else I find.
