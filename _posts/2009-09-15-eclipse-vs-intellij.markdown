I’ve been a looong time eclipse user and have tried intellij off and on over that time. I never really got hooked on intellij like some people I know…until recently. I’m not sure why it stuck with me this time, but this post will serve as my list that I can point people to when I get asked “the question”

### IntelliJ - The Good

* Selectable color themes (absolute pain in eclipse)
* Maven works out of the box
* better plugin manager
* better ruby support (which gives me cucumber syntax highlighting)
* when extracting methods, variables, etc. just put your cursor anywhere on the expression and pick which one you want if there are multiple (eclipse has to have the exact expression highlighted)

Not too much for now, but I’ll add to it as thing come to me.
